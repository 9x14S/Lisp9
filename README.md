# Lisp9

Common (or maybe some other dialect once I decide) Lisp interpreter.

### Compilation

Compilation should work just by running `make`, which should generate a binary
file called `lisp`, use it to read .lsp files or, without arguments, as an
interactive interpreter.
(WIP, there's nothing to compile yet)

### Cleaning

`make clean` should remove all object files,
`make fclean` should remove all object files and the target.
